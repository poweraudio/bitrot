**PowerAudio fork of Bitrot**

This fork of Bitrot has the following changes:

* Replaced `waf` binary blob with [autowaf] in source form.
* In the [`lv2-only`] branch, added build option `--lv2-only` to build plugins
  only as LV2.

[autowaf]: https://github.com/drobilla/autowaf
[`lv2-only`]: https://github.com/poweraudio/bitrot/tree/lv2-only

Bitrot 0.7

This is an early version of what will become Bitrot 1.0.
As the code has been rewritten there might be unforeseen bugs, so please [report](https://github.com/grejppi/bitrot/issues) any new bugs you encounter! ðŸ˜Š

## How to build

### on Linux

```
./waf configure [--platform {linux32|linux64|win32|win64}]
./waf
```

You will find the built plugins in the `build/` folder.

### anywhere else

If you are not running Linux, or want to build the software in
an isolated environment, you can build it in a virtual machine.

First, please download and install:
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

After you have installed those, open a command line in the repository
root and run these commands:

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

This will initialize the virtual machine, which will take time,
and then open an SSH session in the virtual machine.
Once the session is open, please run:

```
cd /vagrant
./waf configure --platform {linux32|linux64|win32|win64}
./waf
```

You will find the built plugins in the `build/` folder.

Finally you may shut down the virtual machine using

```
vagrant halt
```

or

```
vagrant destroy
```

if you are never going to need it again.
